		<h1>Use Case</h1>
		<h2><b>Use Case&#58;</b></h2>
		<p>Adam has decided that it is time to upgrade his phone. He is looking for an easy way to see the specifications for different mobile devices. He would also like to be able to do a side by side comparison. It would also be a plus if there was a polling system that shows how people want, have, or used to have the same model of a device. This way he could see which devices are very popular.</p>
		<h2>User Story&#58;</h2>
		<p>Adam needs a way to compare which phones have the best processor.</p>
		<h2><b>Frustrations&#58;</b></h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Not having all of a phone specifications all on one page</li>
				<li>Not being able to compare phones side by side</li>
				<li>Not being able to see that raw data of a phone vs someone reviewing and telling him why he should like something. He wants to draw conclusions for himself.</li>
				<li>Not being able to see how many other people have or want a specific mobile device</li>
			</ul>
		<h2><b>Interaction Flow&#58;</b></h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Adam arrives at the homepage</li>
				<li>The webpage displays many click-able articles about the most popular phones on the market</li>
				<li>Adam clicks on one that displays the Iphone X</li>
				<li>Server displays webpage that shows all the specifications for iphone X as well as suggestions to compare other popular models</li>
				<li>Adam review specifications and decides he wants the Iphone X and navigates to the poll on the webpage and clicks the want button</li>
				<li>Adam navigates to the poll on the webpage</li>
				<li>Adam clicks on the want button</li>
				<li>The server then adds +1 to the count of want</li>
				<li>Adam closes browser and goes to purchase a new phone!</li>
